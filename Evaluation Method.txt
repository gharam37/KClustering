Minimum within cluster sum of distances was used to evaluate the best iteration over the 30 iterations.

In the Method EvaluateClusters() We run KCluster() 
1- Loop over the images and calculate the distance between them and their centers.
2- sum all distance
3- repeat 30 times
4- compare the 30 distances
5- take the minimum
6- output the run with the minimum within cluster distance
